# RAN-App

## Commands

This is the [RAN](https://www.rantoolkit.com/) originally created with  graph.cool service for GraphQL and now for hosting in the example. It is completely refactored to use the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) server. 

## Documentation

## How to use

You can now [deploy](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/cli-command-reference/database-service/prisma-deploy-kee1iedaov) the Prisma service (note that this requires you to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine - if that's not the case, follow the collapsed instructions below the code block):

```sh
cd ran-app
yarn && yarn setup
```
If you are not using Yarn, just run npm install && npm run setup instead of yarn && yarn setup
After everything is finished, run yarn dev (or npm run dev)
