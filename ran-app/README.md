# RAN-App

## Commands

[RAN](https://www.rantoolkit.com/) app is  originally created with  graph.cool service for GraphQL. It is  completely refactored  to use the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) server for the GraphQL service.

## How to use

You can now [deploy](https://www.prisma.io/docs/reference/cli-command-reference/database-service/prisma-deploy-kee1iedaov) the Prisma service (note that this requires you to have [Docker](https://www.docker.com) installed on your machine - if that's not the case, follow the collapsed instructions below the code block):

```sh
# Navigate to the Folder 
cd ran-app
# Install the packages 
yarn && yarn setup
# Run the sever 
yarn dev
```
If you are not using Yarn, just run npm install && npm run setup instead of yarn && yarn setup
After everything is finished, npm run dev
